# Audio Amplifier Build (Club Project)

This project documents the assembly, testing, and troubleshooting of a small audio amplifier built as part of the Iowa State Audio and Arduino Club desktop AMP project.

The amplifier was constructed by following a provided schematic and soldering components onto a PCB. After initial assembly, audio output was validated using speakers salvaged from a pair of old headphones.

## Overview
- Built a discrete audio amplifier from provided instructions
- Soldered all components by hand
- Performed functional testing and troubleshooting
- Adapted output hardware to verify audio functionality

## Build Process
- Followed step-by-step instructions provided by the club instructor
- Soldered all components onto PCB
- Verified amplifier output with repurposed headphone speakers


## Testing & Troubleshooting
- Initial testing failed due to lack of compatible external speakers
- Repurposed small speakers from old headphones to validate audio output
- Confirmed amplifier functionality through audible signal output

## Notes
- Project focuses on hardware assembly and verification rather than custom circuit design
- Demonstrates soldering, schematic interpretation, and practical troubleshooting skills
